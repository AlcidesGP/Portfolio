## Introduction

Computer vision is a multidisciplinary field of computer science aimed at automating the interpretation of information from images and videos. It plays a fundamental role in a variety of modern applications, from facial recognition to motion analysis in security systems.

In the context of image processing for counting elements in specific areas, computer vision offers a powerful and efficient approach to monitor and analyze object behavior in complex environments. This capability has significant applications in sectors such as transportation, public safety, retail, and more.

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to use computer vision techniques to count elements within delimited areas in a video. In this specific example, we aim to identify and count vehicles entering and exiting zones of interest in a traffic video.

This approach can be adapted and extended for a wide range of applications, from intelligent surveillance systems to optimizing pedestrian flow in urban spaces. The ability to process and understand visual information in real-time opens doors to significant innovations across various domains.

If you have interest or questions about applying these techniques in your own projects, feel free to reach out or explore further the code and concepts presented in this repository.

## Data

The video used for this example is `highway_traffic_short.mp4`, which depicts traffic on an urban highway. The video has been processed to identify and count vehicles in specific areas of the scene.

## Libraries

The code utilizes the following Python libraries:

- `cv2`: OpenCV, a popular computer vision library.
- `ultralytics.YOLO`: A pre-trained YOLO model for object detection.
- `supervision`: A library for video processing and object analysis.
- `matplotlib.pyplot`: For result visualization.
- `numpy`: For efficient numerical array manipulation.
- `time`: For measuring execution time.

Ensure you have all these libraries installed before running the code.

## Conclusion

The provided example demonstrates a practical application of computer vision in counting elements within delimited areas in a traffic video. This technique can be extended to numerous other applications, such as security monitoring, flow analysis in urban environments, public space optimization, and more. The ability to process and analyze images in an automated manner opens doors to countless innovative solutions across various fields.
